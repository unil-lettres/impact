# Introduction

# Development

## Docker installation

A working [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installation is mandatory.

## Docker environment file

Please make sure to copy & rename the **example.env** file to **.env**.

``cp dev/example.env dev/.env``

You can replace the values if needed, but the default ones should work.

## Edit hosts file

Edit hosts file to point **impact.lan** to your docker host.

## Environment installation & configuration

Run the following docker commands from the project root directory.

Build & run all the containers for this project.

``docker-compose up``

Run the setup script separately. The laravel-worker process will not work until the setup script is applied.

This is only needed when you launch the project for the first time. After that you can simply use the following command from the project root directory.

``docker-compose up -d``
