``docker exec impact-app php artisan db:seed``

If you want completely wipe your database and populate it with fresh data, you can use the following command.

``docker exec impact-app npm run dev``

or if you want to watch for changes.

``docker exec impact-app npm run watch``

# Deployment with Docker

## Environment files

Copy and rename the following environment files.

```
cp docker/example.env docker/.env
cp site/.env.example site/.env
```

You should replace the values since the default ones are not ready for production.

To authenticate with Shibboleth, don't forget to uncomment and set the `SHIB_HOSTNAME` and `SHIB_CONTACT` variables in `site/.env`, otherwise you only be abel to use the local authentication.

Please also make sure to copy & rename the **docker-compose.override.yml.prod** file to **docker-compose.override.yml**.

`cp docker-compose.override.yml.prod docker-compose.override.yml`

You can replace the values if needed, but the default ones should work for production.

## Installation & configuration

Build & run all the containers for this project.

`docker compose up -d`

## Reverse proxy

Use a reverse proxy configuration to map the url to port `8787`.

# Docker images

Changes in the `development` branch will create new images tagged `(worker-)latest-dev` & `(worker-)latest-stage`, while changes in the `master` branch will create an image tagged `(worker-)latest`. And finally, when a new tag is created, an image with the matching tag will be automatically built.
