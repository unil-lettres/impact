         * Each editing users poll the server every x seconds to check if
         * another user is editing the same card. This is done using the
         * Laravel Cache. Each user get the cache at the key of the card he is
         * editing and replace the value by its own user id. If the value was
         * already set by another user, the current user knows that another
         * user is editing the card.
         *
         * A benefit of this approach is that the user don't have to
         * unsubscribe to anything when he leaves the page as other users will
         * overwrite his presence in the cache.
         *
         * The drawback of this approach is when the user make two subsequent
         * requests to the server (if some user have a very low-end connection)
         * it can result in a false negative. To mitigate this, we use the
         * `$wasConcurrentEditing` property to wait two "cycles" before turning
         * off the warning. The more users are editing, the less likely this
         * will happen.
